Here with the help of python libraries and ML algorithm, I am analyzing and predicting the different species of Iris presented to us with the data.
I have used all the necessary python libraries like:

### For basic funtionality-
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn

### For exploratory data analysis:
* Matplotlib
* Plotly
* Seaborn
* Cufflinks

### For model building and prediction:
* Sklearn

The models that I have used for prediction are:
* Decision Tree (97.7% accuracy)
* KNN (97.7% accuracy)
* K Means Clustering

The species column in the dataset contains 3 class namely:
* Iris - Setosa
* Iris - Versicolor
* Iris - virginica

The dataset is already present in the repository.
